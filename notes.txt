Domain and Grid Validation:

Check for a valid grid size and ensure it is consistent with the parent grid ratio.
Verify that the domain is within the Earth's bounds (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180).
Check if the domain covers the area of interest, and if required, ensure nested domains are within the parent domain.
Time Control Parameters:

Validate the input start and end times.
Check if the time step is appropriate for the chosen grid size and model stability.
Confirm that the output interval is within the simulation period.
Vertical Coordinate System:

Ensure the number of vertical levels and the top model level are within acceptable ranges.
Validate the selected vertical coordinate system (e.g., eta, sigma, or hybrid) based on the user's application.
Physics Options:

Validate the choice of microphysics, cumulus parameterization, and planetary boundary layer schemes based on the region's climate characteristics.
Check the consistency of radiation and surface-layer schemes with other selected physics options.
If required, verify the appropriate choice of lake, urban, and aerosol models.
Dynamics Options:

Validate the selected advection schemes for horizontal and vertical motions.
Check if the chosen diffusion options are suitable for the user's research objectives.
Nesting Options:

Verify the nesting configurations, including one-way or two-way interaction and feedback options.
Check if the time step ratio and parent grid ratio are consistent for the nested domains.
Regional Adaptation:

Ensure that the namelist parameters are adjusted according to the region's weather and climate characteristics (e.g., tropical vs. polar regions).
If necessary, validate specific options such as the use of a topography-following coordinate system or the selection of high-resolution datasets for certain regions.
Optional Model Configurations:

Validate the use of specific options like lake models, urban canopy models, or ocean coupling if applicable to the user's study.
